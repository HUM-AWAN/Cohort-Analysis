# Cohort-Analysis
This PostgreSQL code script is for cohort analysis table creation. 
The script uses files (first_purchases.csv and purchases.csv) for the final table creation that could be used for data visualization. Later, you can use this table to be visualized in python and/or Tableau as you wish to continue. I visualized the final table in Tableau, therefore, no python codes are available for this cohort analysis.
